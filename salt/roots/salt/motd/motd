Welcome to the Alert Manager Development Virtual Machine:

Run 'start_alert_manager' to get going and then visit:
http://10.31.41.59:5000/alerts.html

Use 'ctrl/command+c' to stop the application as needed.

Edit code directly in this VM. Or, you can edit from
outside the VM with your IDE of choice. Code changes
should trigger an automatic reload of the application.

Docs are available here [1] and here [2], and real live
people can be found on IRC irc://irc.mozilla.org/#ateam
